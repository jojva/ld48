## The story

The **dwarves** need a more ecofriendly way to **light their mine**, so they built something to channel just enough sunlight into their deepest tunnels.
Unfortunately they are not very good at reading construction plans, and now they need your help to put mirrors and change the orientation of each level so that the light reaches the bottom end.

## Instructions

- The goal is to bring the light down to the lowest level
- Click on a junction tile to place, rotate, or remove a mirror, in order to bounce light a different way
- Press the W or S key to select the upper or lower level
- Press the A or D key to rotate the selected level
- Press the Q or E key to turn around
